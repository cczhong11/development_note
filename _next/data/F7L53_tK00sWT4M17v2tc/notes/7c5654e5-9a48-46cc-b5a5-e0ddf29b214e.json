Recovery algorithm has two parts: actions during normal transaction, actions after a failure to recover the database.The key primitives are UNDO, the process of removing the effects of an incomplete or aborted transaction. REDO: the process of re-instating the effects of a committed transaction for durability.</p>\n<p>Storage can be volatile storage, data will be lost after powering off. Non-Volatile have data persistent after powering off. Stable storage never lose data. It could achieve approximately by using multiple storages. </p>\n<p>Failure can be transaction failure: transaction cannot complete due to some internal error and DBMS must terminate an active transaction due to an error condition. System failure is DBMS fails and system is crashed, non-volatile storage are not corrupted. Storage media failure is a disk failure and destroy parts of non-volatile storage. </p>\n<p><strong>Buffer pool management steal policies</strong> will decide whether the DBMS allow an uncommitted transaction to overwrite the most recent committed value of an object in non-volatile storage. No-steal policy will not write uncommitted transaction value back to disk,  steal policy, allows the system to write modified blocks to disk even if the transactions that made those modifications have not all committed, could steal other transaction's memory. Force policy ensures that all updates made by a transaction are reflected on non-volatile\nstorage before the transaction is allowed to commit. No-force is not enforced to do this. NO-STEAL + FORCE means no redo: all committed transactions' changes are reflected in disk, no undo: all aborted transactions' changes are not written to disk. Limitation is memory because of no-steal policy.</p>\n<p>Shadow paging means updates are only made in the shadow copy. When a transaction commits, atomically switch the shadow to become the new master. Disadvantages: Copying the entire page table is expensive and the commit overhead is high. Organize the database pages in a tree structure where the root is a single disk page. The root points to the master copy, updates are applied to the shadow copy. To install updates, overwrite the root so it points to the shadow, thereby swapping the master and\nshadow. For undo, it remove the shadow pages. Leave master and the DB root pointer alone. Do not need redo.</p>\n<p><strong>Write-Ahead Logging</strong> means DBMS records all changes made to the db in log file before changes is made to a disk page. The log contains information to perform undo and redo. It has fast runtime performance but slow recovery time. Log records are written to disk before update is allowed to be written on disk. Transaction is committed until all its log records have been written to stable storage.Write BEGIN in the beginning, COMMITTED to make sure all log records are flushed. Log records contains tid, object id, before value(UNDO), after value(REDO). If we use NO-STEAL policy, we don't need original value, but in that way we could not undo for aborted transaction.</p>\n<p>DBMS can periodically takes a checkpoint where it flushes all buffers out to disk. The DBMS stops accepting new transactions and waits for all active transactions to complete. Flush all log records and dirty blocks currently residing in main memory to stable storage. Write a <checkpoint> entry to the log and flush to stable storage.</checkpoint></p>\n<p>Logging schemes could be physical logging: record the changes made to a specific location in the database. Logical logging records the high operations executed by transactions. Physiological logging means log records target a single page but do not specify data organization of the page.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aries\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#aries\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>ARIES</h2>\n<p>Algorithms for Recovery and Isolation Exploiting Semantics. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>WAL</li>\n<li>Repeat history in redo</li>\n<li>logging changes during undo</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In WAL, each log record has a global unique log sequence number.

All log records to to transaction’s COMMIT record are flushed to disk. When the commit succeeds, write a special TXN-END record to log. </p>\n<p>Transaction abort just an UNDO operation. Use prevLSN to undo transaction. Compensation Log Record, CLR describes the actions taken to undo the actions of a previous update record.

It uses\n<strong>Active Transaction Table (ATT)</strong> to record active transaction and their lastLSN(most recent lsn written by transaction). Entry is removed when transaction commits or aborts. In <strong>Dirty Page Table (DPT)</strong>, it keeps track of pages in the buffer pool contain changes from uncommitted transactions. And there is <strong>recLSN</strong> field, the LSN of the log record that first caused the page to be dirty.</p>\n<p>Fuzzy checkpoints allows other transactions to continue to run.
