The most common solution for this is called leader-based replication</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/2021-05-11-21-10-46.png\"></p>\n<p>An important detail of a replicated system is whether the replication happens syn‐chronously or asynchronous</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/2021-05-11-21-12-13.png\"></p>\n<p>replication to follower 1 is synchronous: the leader waits until follower 1 has confirmed that it received the write before reporting success to the user, and before making the write visible to other clients. The replication to follower 2 is asynchronous: the leader sends the message, but doesn’t wait for a response from the follower.</p>\n<p>The advantage of synchronous replication is that the follower is guaranteed to have an up-to-date copy of the data that is consistent with the leader. If the leader sud‐denly fails, we can be sure that the data is still available on the follower. The disad‐vantage is that if the synchronous follower doesn’t respond (because it has crashed, or there is a network fault, or for any other reason), the write cannot be processed.\nThe leader must block all writes and wait until the synchronous replica is available again.</p>\n<p>In practice, if you enable syn‐chronous replication on a database, it usually means that one of the followers is syn‐chronous, and the others are asynchronous. If the synchronous follower becomes unavailable or slow, one of the asynchronous followers is made synchronous. This guarantees that you have an up-to-date copy of the data on at least two nodes. This configuration is sometimes also called semi-synchronous.</p>\n<p>leader-based replication is configured to be completely asynchronous. In this case, if the leader fails and is not recoverable, any writes that have not yet been repli‐cated to followers are lost. This means that a write is not guaranteed to be durable, even if it has been confirmed to the client. However, a fully asynchronous configura‐tion has the advantage that the leader can continue processing writes, even if all of its followers have fallen behind.</p>\n<h2 id=\"setting-up-new-followers\">Setting Up New Followers<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#setting-up-new-followers\"></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Take a consistent snapshot of the leader’s database at some point in time</li>\n<li>Copy the snapshot to the new follower node.</li>\n<li>The follower connects to the leader and requests all the data changes that have happened since the snapshot was taken</li>\n<li>When the follower has processed the backlog of data changes since the snapshot, we say it has caught up.

We can use the exact same log to build a replica on another node: besides writing the log to disk, the leader also sends it across the network to its followers.</p>\n<p>. The main disadvantage is that the log describes the data on a very low level: a WAL con‐tains details of which bytes were changed in which disk blocks. This makes replica‐tion closely coupled to the storage engine. If the database changes its storage format from one version to another, it is typically not possible to run different versions of the database software on the leader and the followers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"logical-row-based-log-replication\">Logical (row-based) log replication<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#logical-row-based-log-replication\"></a></h2>\n<p>An alternative is to use different log formats for replication and for the storage engine, which allows the replication log to be decoupled from the storage engine internals. This kind of replication log is called a logical log, to distinguish it from the storage engine’s (physical) data representation.</p>\n<p>A logical log for a relational database is usually a sequence of records describing writes to database tables at the granularity of a row: </p>\n<p>• For an inserted row, the log contains the new values of all columns.\n• For a deleted row, the log contains enough information to uniquely identify the row that was deleted. Typically this would be the primary key, but if there is no primary key on the table, the old values of all columns need to be logged.\n• For an updated row, the log contains enough information to uniquely identify the updated row, and the new values of all columns (or at least the new values of all columns that changed)</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"0f1b48c7-3a25-4016-83a5-15864d7803ad","title":"Development","vault":{"fsPath":"repos/dendron-aws-vault","remote":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/cczhong11/my_note.git"},"name":"my_note"},"type":"note","desc":"","links":[{"from":{"fname":"root","id":"c95dc4f5-23db-45e7-a15b-64582a183ccc","vaultName":"my_note"},"type":"backlink","position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":3,"offset":63},"end":{"line":8,"column":21,"offset":81},"indent":[]},"value":"development"}],"anchors":{},"fname":"development","updated":1618381238346,"created":1612940782409,"parent":null,"children":["400115e9-30f7-4a13-9776-db059bc9cd42","xsX5v3ZsyJ0i6gf9","1bc3b45a-b6f4-4150-87d3-5bd5b6eb8c24","6cea4852-6e7c-4140-b476-85c07b48a642","a40ef849-d301-4d74-a778-e6d9469dfb5d","09d9081f-3dff-453d-8488-7d2344cc8895","p11phg7nb10yw0wck1fyagq","92917ea3-452e-48dc-875e-5cd0002041db","2e151826-cb22-4d89-8ce0-71dad7204ce8","baa39444-0da9-4c55-8df7-2a6f8f787fa4","q4um3bc3st86ilkkvdjom6x","62daf50d-a39e-463f-aabd-be53790281fd","3524d0a7-be73-45d6-847e-c970f5c1c760","eac0f243-05b3-4b95-bec3-848e33edbc40","nc777xa48letazo00100hin"],"data":{},"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"body":"\n","contentHash":"38357962f5a50c6fd7d318dfa66bea90"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"previewV2Enabled":false,"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"dendronVersion":"0.90.0","vaults":[{"fsPath":"repos/dendron-aws-vault","remote":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/cczhong11/my_note.git"},"name":"my_note"},{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableHandlebarTemplates":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enablePersistentHistory":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["development","life"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"my_note","description":"Personal knowledge space"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","enableMermaid":true,"siteUrl":"https://notes.tczhong.com","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"development"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
