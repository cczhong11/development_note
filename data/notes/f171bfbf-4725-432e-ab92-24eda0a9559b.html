<p>For replica configurations,  Master-Replica will receive all updates and it propagates those updates to its replicas. K-safety is a threshold for determining the fault tolerance of the replicated database. The value K represents the number of replicas per data object that must exist at all times.</p>

<p>When a txn commits on a replicated database, the DBMS has to decide whether it has to wait for that txn's changes to propagate to other nodes before it can send the acknowledgement to application.</p>
<ul>
<li>Synchronous: The master sends updates to replicas and then waits for them to acknowledge that they fully applied (i.e., logged) the changes.</li>
<li>Asynchronous: The master immediately returns the acknowledgement to the client without waiting for replicas to apply the changes.</li>
<li>Semi-Synchronous:  Replicas immediately send acknowledgements without logging them</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>It asks all replicas for their version number</li>
<li>It then asks the replica with the greatest version number for the file</li>
<li>If the servers don't agree about the files version, the client can direct the servers to update a client that is behind, or inform them of a conflict. CVVs are compared just like vector timestamps. A conflict exists if two CVVs are concurrent, because concurrent vectors indicate that each server involved has seen some changes to the file, but not all changes.</li>
