# ulimit 

“ulimit” is an interesting Linux shell command that can set or report the resource limit of the current user.

There are 2 types of resource limitation: “hard” and “soft”. Hard resource limit defines the physical limit that the user can reach. The “soft” resource limit is manageable by the user. Its value can go up to the “hard” limit.
