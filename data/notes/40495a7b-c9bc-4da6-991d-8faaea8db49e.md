## data loss

## delay

- processing, time spent in router, check bit error, determine output link
- queueing, depends on congestion level
- transmission delay: L/R bits/ bps
- propagation delay: d/s (length/2*10^8)
- $\lambda$ = avg packet arrival rate(pts/s), traffic intensity: $L \lambda /R$ value -> 1, delay becomlarge.
- nodal delay = $d_{proc}+d_{queue}+d_{trans}+d_{prop}$

### measurement

- tracerouter algo:
   - for all router i:
        - send three packets to router i 
        - router i will return packets to sender
        - measure transmission and reply interval
