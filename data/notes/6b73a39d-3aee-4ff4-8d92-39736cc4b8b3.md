# network layer

ip

**transfer packets across links**, addressing scale to large networks, routing protocol determines best paths across the network


## IP

addressing mechanism: IP ADDRESS 

- No call setup at network layer
- Packets are forwarded using address of the destination host
- Packets are forwarded independently
- Packets between same source-dest pair may take different paths
- addressing
  - Each end-host has unique address
  - Forwarding table maps addresses to outgoing link

### packet

- data types: packet
  - On sending side, encapsulate segment into packets
  - Transmit the packet through the network
  - Network layer protocols exist on all routers (and hosts) for this purpose
  - On receiving side, deliver packets to transport layer

### routing

- Routing (Control Plane)
    - **Involves all routers in a network**
    -  Creates a **forwarding** table to determine end-to-end paths taken by packets
    -  Uses routing algorithms
- Forwarding (Data Plane)
    - Move packets from router’s incoming interface to appropriate outgoing interface
    - An action in a single router
    - use forwarding table
- Connection Setup: setup route states before sending packets

### format

- packet-handling operations at each router
    - forward with destination of address
    - forward independently
- format
    - Version specifies IPv4
    - Header length (in 32-bit words)
    - Type of Service
    - Datagram length (Header + data) 20bytes+data
    - ID, Flags, Offset: Used for fragmentation at router
        - 1 DF Don't fragament
        - 2 MF more fragament
        - ID unique
    - Time-to-Live: Decremented at each router, Datagram dropped if zero
    - Protocol
        - Used by receiver to determine which transport protocol should get packet
    - Header checksum: Calculated only on header
        - Must be recomputed at each router: because ttl changes
    - use checksum because other protocol maybe involved
    - Data: Encapsulated TCP/UDP segment . ICMP data

### ipv4

- prefix notation: range of subnet 128.2.101.64/26
    - 6 bit free
    - example: 223.1.17.0/25 for /24 half, 223.1.17.128/26 for 64, 223.1.17.192/26 for 64
- forwarding tables:
    - put prefix matching in destination prefix
    - match the leading bits of destination address to the longest listed prefix: **longest matching prefix rule**
- CIDR classless interdomain routing

### ICMP

- single ip packet
    - no reliability
    - type/ code for echo/unreachable....
- traceroute:
    - send nth udp segments has TTL of n
    - replies with ICMP time exceeded
- is a network-layer protocol
    - Messages used for communication between routers and end-hosts
    - Messages sent in an IP packet - Just like a UDP segment
    - Messages require special processing by the IP layer software on each router

### forwarding table

- 每次更新新加入的点到未加入点的距离。每次从未加入点中选一个距离到已加入的set里最小的
  - short path tree
  - use dijkstra's to get routing table
  - O(n^2)

bellman-ford

- Each node periodically sends its own distance vector estimates to neighbors
- When a node x receives a new DV estimate from a neighbor v, uses B-F
- Dx(y) ←minv{c(x,v)+Dv(y)} for each y ∈ N
- The estimate Dx(y) converges to the actual dx(y) for minor, natural conditions

## AS

- A collection of physical networks with a unif
    - ISP, A Corporate network, A Campus networ
- An AS may get an AS number (ASN)
    - ASNs represent units of routing policy
- AS can have one/many/none ASN


## BGP

- function
    - Obtain network reachability information from neighboring AS
    - Propagate the reachability information to all routers internal to the AS
    - Determine “good” routes to subnets based on the reachability information and on AS policy
    - Advertise its existence to the rest of the Internet!
- Uses path vector routing algorithm
- Is heavily policy-based
- Principles of Operation
    - A BGP session is established between routers (TCP)
    - exchange route UPDATE messages while connection is ALIVE
    - message
        - open： set up session
        - keepalive: confirms liveness to neighbor
        - notificatoin: signals an error before
        - UPDATE: Primary message to communicate information about routes
            - Announce or withdraw routes
            - Route = prefix + path attributes
    - eBGP runs between ASes
    - iBGP within AS

## DHCP

- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (IP)
- information carried: a pool of IP addresses, a repository of network details
    -  Provides these details upon request or by default
- methods of communication : broadcast, Send to 255.255.255.255, UDP, port 67
- leases : Used for dynamic allocation, Solution for control of when an address can be given to another client
    - Server allows use of addr for a set period, Client will need to reacquire permission before lease period expires(automatically)
- message format:
    - type: discover, offer, request, ack, release
    - xid: Random transaction value (client 发，用于定位client)
    - chaddr: client hardware identifier
    - siaddr: server’s IP address
    - yiaddr: “your” address
    - options: lots of optional parameters
- the discovery process
    - broadcast first, Multiple servers may respond
    - Client chooses whichever offer it wishes
    - DHCP Request / Ack is repeated to renew a lease


## NAT

- Network Address Translation
    - router manage a subnet
    - map one address space to another
- benefits
    - Work-around to the impending exhaustion of IP addresses  
    -  Also allows for simple address allocation for the subnet
    - “Security”: internal network structure obscured
- objections
    - IPv6 should be used to solve addressing problem
    - Objection 2: Violates end-to-end principle
    - Objection 3: Routers shouldn’t process packets higher than network layer
    - Objection 4: Using port numbers to address hosts
- operations
    - hosts on private network use "non-routable" ip addresses (10.0.0.0/8 172.16.0.0/16 192.168.0.0/16)
    - these addresses are not unique, restricted to the private subnet
    - Router shows a single external IP address
    - Translation table maps external IP / port combinations to internal IP / port
    - rewrite all packets in each direction, changing based on translation table
        - Other fixes also needed to the packet
    -  Packet Fix-up
        - Fix checksums
        - Router must do more than simply change address/port values
- port forwarding.
    - NAT Address Translation Table
    - Translation table is normally initialized by internal traffic
    - Port forwarding specifies values ahead of time


# tool

- ping: send one packets and cal RTT
- traceroute: will send 3 packets to each router it.
