# basic

1. Advantages: dynamic access
2. Disadvantages: **cannot random access and extra memory to save reference to next node**.
3. 动态分配空间，只知道下个节点
4. a sequence of node, each one contains object reference to next one

## 时间复杂度

- insert, delete O(1). 
- search O(n)

## 思路

- 递归[[development.algo.recursive]]
- recursive one by one, each one could be the new linkedlist head: merge, reverse
- two iterates:cycle, overlapping,delete node.
- use dummy head to avoid checking empty: pivoting,using new node to form new list
