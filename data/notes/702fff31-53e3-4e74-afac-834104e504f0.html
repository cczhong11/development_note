<ul>
<li>YARN, which separates the resource management and processing components. The YARN-based architecture is not constrained to MapReduce.
<img src="/pic/yarn.jpg"></li>
<li>The <strong>ResourceManager</strong> tracks how many live nodes and resources are available on the cluster and coordinates what applications submitted by users should get these resources and when</li>
<li><strong>ApplicationMaster</strong> is started to coordinate the execution of all tasks within the application.The ApplicationMaster and tasks that belong to its application run in resource containers controlled by the NodeManagers.</li>
<li>The <strong>NodeManager</strong> is a more generic and efficient version of the TaskTracker. The NodeManager has a number of dynamically created resource containers.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Uberization</strong> is the possibility to run all tasks of a MapReduce job in the ApplicationMaster's JVM if the job is small enough</li>
<li>Binary or source compatibility for MapReduce jobs written for MRv1</li>
<li>An application recovery after the restart of ResourceManager</li>
