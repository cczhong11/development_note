1. Stick to what you know. Presentations fail when you try to present yourself as an expert on something you aren’t.
2. Tell stories, and don’t bother scripting them. Stories are easy to remember so you won’t mess them up. Script your transitions, and you’ll be set.
3. Practice more than you think you need to. Long, boring practice is what sets professional speakers apart from amateurs.
4. Chunk your speeches. Don’t get stuck thinking you have to work through it in a linear fashion.
5. Slow your brain down. When your brain is moving too fast, you start to stumble on your words.
6. Don’t wander. The temptation to step off the trail will be high. Once you do, it will be difficult to come back.
7. Always save a few moments for your pre-talk calming routine. Never go on stage without doing this first.
8. Ignore your mistakes. Context is more important than perfect delivery. If you mess up, keep going.
Remember the audience wants you to succeed. Everything is easier when you remember everyone is on your side.
