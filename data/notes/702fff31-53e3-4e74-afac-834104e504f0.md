- YARN, which separates the resource management and processing components. The YARN-based architecture is not constrained to MapReduce.

- The **ResourceManager** tracks how many live nodes and resources are available on the cluster and coordinates what applications submitted by users should get these resources and when
- **ApplicationMaster** is started to coordinate the execution of all tasks within the application.The ApplicationMaster and tasks that belong to its application run in resource containers controlled by the NodeManagers.
- The **NodeManager** is a more generic and efficient version of the TaskTracker. The NodeManager has a number of dynamically created resource containers.

## features

- **Uberization** is the possibility to run all tasks of a MapReduce job in the ApplicationMaster's JVM if the job is small enough
- Binary or source compatibility for MapReduce jobs written for MRv1
- An application recovery after the restart of ResourceManager
