# Classical Non-Distributed Concurrency Control 

## spin-lock

- **what**:Atomic compare-and-swap/test-and-set instructions
- **why**: easy
- **how**: Requires locking memory bus on multi-core/multi-processor
- **problem**:Busy wait not good for high contention. busy-waiting, busy-looping or spinning is a technique in which a process repeatedly checks to see if a condition is true, such as whether keyboard input or a lock is available.

## mutex

- **what**:Semaphores, At-Most-N policies,Mutual Exclusion
- **why**:Conceptually,manages a pool of resources.
- **how**:
    - P operation: Wait for resource to be available (lock s-=1)
    - V operation: Make resource available (unlock s+=1)
    - Deschedule (move to blocked queue) blocked thread or process 
    - Reschedule (move to ready queue) when resource available
    - 初始s=1，s不会是负值

## CONDITION VARIABLES

Event based 

- Wait – always waits. No predicate
- Signal – Wake up a waiter
- Broadcast – Wake up all waiters.
