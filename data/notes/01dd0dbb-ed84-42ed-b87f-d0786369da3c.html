<p>Chef is a powerful automation platform that transforms infrastructure into code. Chef is a tool for which you write scripts that are used to automate processes.</p>
<p>Chef Server: The Chef Server is the central store of your infrastructure’s configuration data. The Chef Server stores the data necessary to configure your nodes and provides search, a powerful tool that allows you to dynamically drive node configuration based on data.
Chef Node: A Node is any host that is configured using Chef-client. Chef-client runs on your nodes, contacting the Chef Server for the information necessary to configure the node. Since a Node is a machine that runs the Chef-client software, nodes are sometimes referred to as “clients”.
Chef Workstation: A Chef Workstation is the host you use to modify your cookbooks and other configuration data.</p>
