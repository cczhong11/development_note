- advantages/disadvantages
    - adv:
        - connectionless: no connection establishment, thus no additional delay
        - fast: no handshake
        - each segment handled independently
        - Very simple: no state to maintain
        - Segment header is small
    - dis
        - segments may be lost
        - may out-of-order
        - no congestion control
        - There are no guarantees with UDP.
- segment format
    - source port, dest port, length(**whole segment** at least 8 byte(header size)), checksum, application data
- reliability assumptions
    - Often used for **streaming** multimedia apps 
    - Loss tolerant
    - **Rate sensitive** (timeliness)
    - Reliability can be added at app layer
