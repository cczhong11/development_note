<p>Continuous Integration and continuous Delivery (CI/CD) is a set of software practices and techniques that enable the frequent release of small batches of code changes, with extensive visibility and traceability. It typically involves the creation of a largely automated pipeline that orchestrates the build, test and deployment of software across staged environments, ultimately leading to deployment in production.</p>
<p>CI</p>
<p>During this process, developers identify bugs at early stages of the development cycle, fix them, and test in an iterative manner. Every time there is a new code change or a bug fix, the build or code compilation process takes place in the developer's private workspace. The developer then integrates the changes into the main code base. Depending on the size of the development team, these multiple builds could be running in parallel. Shorter build times lead to developer creativity that can breed innovation.</p>
<p>CD</p>
<p>After the build process and packaging in the CI phase, the final build package is automatically deployed for user acceptance testing before it is released to production. More and more modern applications are running as microservices and containers as the unit of deployment on a platform. The platforms could be any public-cloud environment or containers for platform-as-a-service like Red Hat OpenShift or Pivotal Cloud Foundry. As containers are portable, platform is synonymous with standard operating system like Red Hat, Ubuntu, and others, abstracting the cores and memory required at application run time</p>
<p>Continuous Deployment - refers a system that allows deployment of every new changes that comes in source code from a developer.
Continuous Delivery - refers the automation of entire software release process.</p>
