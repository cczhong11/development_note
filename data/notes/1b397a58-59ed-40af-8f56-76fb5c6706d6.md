- key point: efficient
    - general execution graphs
    - in-memory storage
- Resilient Distributed Datasets
    - Collections of objects spread across a cluster, stored in RAM or on disk
    - build through parallel transformation
    - automatically rebuild on failure 
    - It track lineage information that can be used to efficiently recompute lost data
- DAG scheduler(Directed Acyclic Graph)
    - job: one action for RDD
    - stage: split in shuffle for job
    - task: real task in executor
    - DAG in Apache Spark is a set of Vertices and Edges, where vertices represent the RDDs and the edges represent the Operation to be applied on RDD.
    - know the dependency for different RDD
    - In this way, the execution plan is optimized, e.g. to minimize shuffling data around.
