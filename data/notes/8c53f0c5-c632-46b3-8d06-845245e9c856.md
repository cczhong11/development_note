# data link layer

ethernet, wifi, fiber, telephony

transfer frames: ethernet, PPP, MAC address (add size, error correction codes)

- Inserts framing info to denote frame boundaries
- Inserts control, addressing and error correction info in header
- Detects transmission errors on link. May retransmit frames
- Activation, maintenance, & deactivation of link connection

- mission: transfer frames from one node, over a link
- scope: Service received from physical layer is the ability to move a bit across the link
    - A packet is transferred by different link protocols over different links
    - Each data link protocol provides different services
- addressing mechanism:MAC
- data types : frame
- responsibilities/services
    - Framing:  encapsulate datagram into frame, adding header, trailer; identify source, destination with addresses • Different from IP 
addresses!!
    - Link access: use medium access control (MAC) protocol
    - Error Detection
    - Error Correction
    - Reliable Delivery: critical for wireless links ➙ high error rates

## CSMA/CD

- Carrier Sense: Listen before talking Multiple Access: Broadcast Medium
- Collision Detection: Listen as you talk. If you hear someone else, be quiet
- Capturing a Channel: If no other station initiates transmission during this period, sender has captured the channel. t = tprop
- **Ethernet** is the most famous example
- Before transmitting, listen
- If channel is sensed idle, send the frame 
-  Else, defer transmission a random time
- If collision is detected, abort transmission 
- reduces channel wastage
- **Min transmission time must be long enough for collisions to propagate**
- Length of the packet >= 2 * Tp * Bandwidth of the link worst case


## ARP

- mission: Translate a network-layer address (IP) to a link-layer address (MAC), Similar to DNS
- frame fields:
  - Sender Ethernet and IP address
  - Target Ethernet and IP address
- transmission mechanism
    - Sent in an Ethernet frame to a broadcast address
    - ARP Reply takes the same form
    - broadcast request, if some one know, reply
    - if in another subnet, sent datagram to router 
- caching
    - Each Ethernet adapter uses a table to keep track of known mappings between IP addresses and Ethernet MAC Addrs
    - When given IP address, ARP looks in ARP table and returns corresponding MAC address
        - If IP not in table, queue frame and broadcast ARP request
- security
    - ARP frames are not authenticateds
    - May be spoofed by a malicious entity
    - May be proxied by design
- gratuitous use
    - ARP can be an “announcement” protocol
    - Can send an ARP frame just to update other node’s ARP tables
    - Set target address and sender address to the same value


## csma/ca

- CSMA / Collision Avoidance
- 1. Listen for a specified time (DIFS) If medium is not free:
    - 1. Exponential Backoff (下次请求的时间)
- If medium is free:
    - Transmit entire frame
    - Await ACK frame （AP send ACK to sender）
    - If no ACK, then Exponential Backoff
- ACK
    - protects against bit errors
    - Receiver only sends ACK if frame passes CRC
- Exponential Backoff
    -  Each node chooses a random number 
    -  Max size increases from round to round
    -  Can be modeled as a counter (wait time)
        -  Decremented during any idle time
        -  Put on hold if another node transmits and for a short time afterwards (SIFS)
        -  When zero, the counting station may transmit
