## business

- Tier 1 ISP: big network company in each country, Internet backbone providers
    - direct connect with other tier 1
    - connected to large number of tier-2
    - international in coverage
    - do not buy transit from another provider
    - vertically intergrated: sell services to customers,
    - no single tier-1 ISP can reach the whole Internet, it only peer with Tier-1
- Tier 2 ISP:
    - customers of Tier-1, provider of customers, peers with other tier-2
    - why buy transit from tier-1 provide:
        - usually reginal network and have limited resource
        - need route traffic through Tier-1 ISP to reach a large protion of network
    - why tie2 peer with each other
        - exchanging traffic with a peer, reduce money
        - improve performance
- open peering policy: peer with anyone possible, costs of peering have to be balanced against gains for a Tier-2 ISP.
        - management cost: send approx equal amount of traffic to each other
        - matinentance cost: transmission capacity to meeting point, extra equipment
- content providers:
    - do not sell transit
    - 1. focus on content creation, no peering
    - 2. large-scale players: open peering policy
