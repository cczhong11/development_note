# transport layer

tcp/udp

- end-to-end, broke whole messages to segments

- mission: **Logical** connection, between applications running on different hosts
- Logical communication = as if the applications were directly connected
    - scope: between applications
    - addressing mechanism: multiplex, port numbers bound to an application, 16-bit unsigned number
    - data types: segment
- responsibilities: 
    - **multiplex** messages/de..  end host run **mulitple** applications -> addressing
    - break data to segments and re-assembly
        - segmentation, broken into segments
    - connection setup and state management and tear down
    - TCP: reliability guarantee
    - Transport layer adds header with additional information (port numbers, ...)
