- **what**:recording events as they occur.
- **why**: need to use log to restore
- **how**: combine with checkpoint, periodically checkpoint to save complete state. increment log to maintain updates from that state.
    - synchronous logging: spend so many time to recovery
    - asynchronous: log buffered in memory, reduce overhead, but leave log entries vulnerable to loss.
        - GDV, global dependency vectors
        - interval is how many messages I got since beginning
        - if someone vector is bigger than the original one, it means it is inconsistence
- **problem**: we can use prune log to reduce playback time
    - it may resend messages that having negative effects on system. Use incarnation numbers to enable recipients to do the same.
    - expensive in times


## checkpoint


- **what**: used to restore state. 
- **why**:for global consistent copy.
- **how**: set point, **freezing** the system,no write to maintain consistency. inbound messages will not frozen but write into buffer.
    - uncoordinated checkpoint: 
        - periodically recorded its state
        - need recovery line to recover
    - coordinated checkpoints:
        - record message sequences: know who sent us message since last checkpoint
        - synchronized clocks, add timestamp in all messages and act as a sequence number;:
- **problem**: freeze
- incarnation number: restarted will +1, use this to distinguish whether I should accept this message.
