## possible failure

bit-errors, lossy, duplicate delivery , out-of-order delivery

## methods

- checksums: bit error 
- receiver feedback: bit error, ACK/NACK， Cumulative acknowledgments(I have received all packets with sequence numbers up to but not including sn.) allow acknowledgment of numerous packets at a time. They can be useful in pipelined protocols. 可能lost
- retransmission : Sender sends another copy of segment, detect loss and allows for duplicate seg
- sequence numbers : Distinguish between old and new, Gaps let receiver detect lost segment, find duplicate packets，restoring the transmitted order. have to be a bounded # bits
- timer expiration: Segment or receiver feedback is lost (sender: Resends a packet after a timer fires. Sends a new packet after an acknowledgment (positive) arrives.)
- window:Control sending of multiple segments, allow for reuse of sequence numbers, also allow for pipeling segments

## protocols

### Stop-n-Wait

 - Simplest Protocol that will handle bit errors and segment loss
    - use: checksum, ack, sn, timers
    - 1 bit for sequence number

    - 为了解决checksum返回的时候有问题。可能ack会lost。带来的问题就是可能重复发几次。所以需要seq num

    - 计时发送，看指定时间能否达到response, 没seq num. 接收者不能知道是否是重发。LOST ACK和lost segment对于发送方式一样的


## Go Back N
       
- sliding window: A mechanism to control multiple, in-flight segments without overwhelming receiver, Sender is allowed to transmit N segments without waiting for an ACK
- “window” of up to N, consecutive unACKed segments allowed
- Sets a **timer** for each in-flight segment
- timeout(n): retransmit segment n and all **higher** seq# segments in window
- sender:
  - Sender places a k-bit seq# in header
  - “window” of up to N, consecutive unACKed segments allowed
  - Sets a timer for each in-flight segment
  - timeout(n): retransmit segment n and **all higher** seq# segments in window
  - ACK(n): ACKs all segments up to, including seq# n (Cumulative ACK)
- receiver: ACK-only: always send ACK for correctly-received segment with **highest in-order seq**, Receipt of out-of-order segment just discard and send with highest in-order seq 
    - May generate duplicate ACKs
    - Why discard segs received out-of-order： Don’t want to buffer them, going to be re-sent anyway
- A single segment error can cause many segments to be retransmitted

## Selective Repeat

  - Receiver individually ACKs all correctly received segments
  - Buffers segs for eventual in-order delivery
  - Sender only resends segments for which ACK not received
  - Sets timer for each segment
  - Sender window of N consecutive seq#s
  - Limits seq # s of sent, but unACKed segs

  - issues: both side have varying view, receiver window移动了，但是发送端没收到ack， 会重传。
  - sequence number的space至少是2^k 个，k是window的大小
