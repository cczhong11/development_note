# TCP

- point-to-point / reliable / in-order byte stream / pipelined: sliding windows
- full duplex data: bi-directional data flow
- connection-oriented: handshaking (exchange of control messages) initializes sender & receiver state before data exchange
- Both sides have buffers
- Flow Control
- Congestion Control

## connection and tear down

- establish: setup state before exchanging data segements
  - step1: send SYN segment and specifies initial seq#, no data
  - why random sn? an earlier incarnation of the same connection can interfere with a later one
  - step2: server respond with SYNACK segment, allocates buffers and specifies initial seq#
  - step3: replies with ACK, may contain data
  - if host receive with SYN to a closed port, responds with a RST segments 
- teardown: free up state 
  - step1: send TCP FIN to server
  - step2: server responds with ACK and closed, send FIN
  - step3: client receives FIN, replies with ACK , wait 
  - why? possible ACK lost
  - Client may open the same connection again (same pair of port #s) 
  - then Receives FIN from earlier incarnation of connection
  - so Immediately initiate closing of the later incarnation
  - Step 4: server receives ACK, closes connection


## RDT

  - TCP creates RDT service on top of IP’s unreliable service
    - Pipelined segments 
    - Cumulative acks
    - Retransmission timer
  - Retransmissions are triggered by:
    - timeout events 
    - duplicate acks
  - Initially, we consider simplified TCP sender:
    - ignore duplicate acks
    - ignore flow control, congestion control
    - assume RTT is estimated somehow
  - SN : byte stream “number” of first byte in segment’s data
  - ACKs: seq # of next byte expected from other side
    - **cumulative** ACK: acknowledges bytes up to the first missing byte in the stream
  - Data received from app:
    - Create segment
    - seq# is byte-stream number of first data byte in segment
    - Send, if allowed by congestion & flow-control
    - start timer if not already running (think of timer as for oldest unacked segment)
    - expiration interval: TimeOutInterva
  -  Timeout:
    -  retransmit segment that caused timeout
    -  restart timer
  - ACK received:
    -  If acknowledges previously unACKed segments
    -  update what is known to be ACKed
    -  start timer if there are outstanding segments
  - fast retransmit
    - If segment is lost, there will likely be many duplicate ACKs
    - If sender receives 3 duplicate ACKs, it supposes that segment after ACKed data was lost: resend segment before timer expires： voodoo constant

## Flow control

- mission: Sender won’t overflow the **receiver’s buffer** by transmitting too much, too fast
  - matching the send rate to the receiving app’s drain rate
  - operation:
- mechanism
    - RcvWindow = RcvBuffer - [ LastByteRcvd - LastByteRead ] (assume discard out of order)
    - Receiver advertises spare room by including value of RcvWindow in ACK segment
    - Gives sender permission to send this much

- congwin: how much data allowed in-flight at any time, >= LastByteSent-LastByteAcked
    - **rate = congwin/RTT**
- sender perceive congestion: timeout / 3 duplicate ACKs
- self-clocking nature: use ACK to trigger its increase in congestion window size
- interaction of various phases 
  - When CongWin is below Threshold, window grows exponentially (slow-start phase)
  - When CongWin is above Threshold, window grows linearly (congestion-avoidance phase)
  - When a triple duplicate ACK occurs, Threshold set to CongWin/2 and CongWin set to Threshold. Window grows linearly
  - When timeout occurs, Threshold set to CongWin/2 and CongWin is set to 1 MSS. Enters slow-start phase
- slow start
  - start with MSS = 1, increase exponentially, done by increasing CongWin by 1MSS for every ACK received
  - With Slow Start, no bandwidth wasted on retransmission
  - end: first lost event
- congestion avoidance
    - start: first lost event
        - cut CongWin in half after a loss event
        - Continue probing for usable bandwidth
    - Reno: after 3 dup, cancel slow start, cut half CongWin, grows linearly
        - after timeout, set ssthrehold to half, skip ss, fast recovery.
        - fast retransmit:  after 3 dup
    - Tahoe: after loss event, congwin set to 1, enter slow start
- how TCP sets timeout values.
    - longer than RTT. 
    - too short, premature timeout, unnecessary retransmissions
    - too long, slow reaction to segment loss
    - need to measure RTT for baseline
