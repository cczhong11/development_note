<p>SLICK is a dedicated SLO(service level objectives). With SLICK, we are able to centralize SLI and SLO definitions to easily find and understand another service’s reliability; provide service owners with insights using high-retention, full granularity data for key service metrics not found in other tools; and integrate SLOs with various other workflows at the company to ensure that SLOs become a part of day-to-day work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Define SLOs in a unified way for our services</li>
<li>Have up to per-minute granularity metric data with up to two years of retention</li>
<li>Have standard visualizations and insights for SLI/SLO metrics</li>
<li>Send periodic reliability reports to internal groups, allowing teams to use them for reliability reviews</li>
</ul>

<li>SLICK Configs: A config file written using SLICK’s DSL, committed by the user to the SLICK config store.</li>
<li>SLICK Syncer: A service that synchronizes changes made to SLICK configs into SLICK’s config metadata storage.</li>
<li>SLICK UI: These are the generated SLICK dashboards for every service. The SLICK UI also provides the index mentioned previously.</li>
<li>SLICK Service: A server that provides an API that is able to answer queries such as “How to compute the SLO for a specific visualization?”. The server allows us to abstract away all the details around data placement and sharding, and it enables the caller to easily find the data needed.</li>
<li>SLICK Data Pipelines: Pipelines that periodically run in order to capture SLI data over the long term.</li>
