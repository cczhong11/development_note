# Scalability

describe a systemâ€™s ability to cope with increased load.

## Load

Load can be described with a few numbers which we call load parameters

The best choice of parameters depends on the architecture of your system

## Performance

- When you increase a load parameter and keep the system resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, etc.) unchanged, how is the performance of your system affected?
- When you increase a load parameter, how much do you need to increase the resources if you want to keep performance unchanged?

- throughput (the number of records we can process per second)
- response time (the time between a client sending a request and receiving a response.)

## scale

- scaling up (**vertical scaling**, moving to a more powerful machine) 
- scaling out (**horizontal scaling**, distributing the load across multiple smaller machines).
